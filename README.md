# YOUTUBE_DATA_HARVESTING

Youtube Data Harvesting and warehousing is a project to provide users with ability to access and analyse data from youtube channels using API Key.SQL ,MONGODB and STREAMLIT are used in this project to develop applications that allows users to get,save and query youtube channels and videos data

LIBRARIES: *)googleapiclient.discovery *)pymongo *)psycopg2 *)pandas *)streamlit

TOOLS: *)PYTHON: Python is known for its clean and easy-to-read syntax, which makes it accessible to beginners and enjoyable for experienced programmers.Python is a highly versatile language used in various domains such as web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, and more. Its extensive standard library provides modules and packages for a wide range of tasks, allowing developers to accomplish complex tasks with minimal effort.

*)GOOGLE API CLIENT: The Google API Client library provides a unified way to access various Google APIs, including Google Cloud Platform services, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Maps, and many others.The Google API Client for YouTube API v3 provides developers with access to a wide range of YouTube data and functionality. This includes the ability to retrieve information about videos, channels, playlists, comments, and more.

*)MONGODB: MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed database service provided by MongoDB, Inc. It allows users to deploy, operate, and scale MongoDB databases with ease in the cloud. With Atlas, users can focus on building their applications while MongoDB takes care of managing the database infrastructure, including provisioning, monitoring, backups, security, and updates.

*)POSTGRESQL: PostgreSQL provides a robust and reliable relational database management system (RDBMS) that can efficiently store and manage the harvested data from YouTube. With its support for various data types, indexing mechanisms, and advanced querying capabilities, PostgreSQL enables users to organize and manipulate YouTube data effectively.

*)STREAMLIT: Streamlit is designed for rapid prototyping and development of data-centric web applications in Python. It simplifies the process of creating interactive data visualizations, dashboards, and machine learning prototypes by providing an intuitive and declarative interface.

*)FEATURES: The following functions are available in the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing application: Retrieval of channel and video data from YouTube using the YouTube API.

Storage of data in a MongoDB database as a data lake.

Migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.

Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database using different search options.
